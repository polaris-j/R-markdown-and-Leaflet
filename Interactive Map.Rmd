## Interactive Map
### 4/28/2021

## R Markdown and Leaflet
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 



```{r, }
library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=2.349014, lat=48.864716, popup="Paris")
m  # Print the map
```
